Q1. What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language.

Q2. Why is Java platform-independent?
Because Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on any JVM.

Q3. What is bytecode in Java?
Bytecode is an intermediate code generated by the Java compiler.

Q4. Why does Java use bytecode instead of direct machine code?
To achieve platform independence and portability.

Q5. What is JVM and what does it do?
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) executes bytecode and manages memory and security.

Q6. Difference between JDK, JRE, JVM?
JDK = development tools + JRE, JRE = JVM + libraries, JVM = runs bytecode.

Q7. What is WORA?
Write Once, Run Anywhere means Java code runs on any platform without change.

Q8. Why is Java more secure than C/C++?
It avoids pointers, supports bytecode verification, and has a security manager.

Q9. Role of the JIT compiler?
JIT converts bytecode into native machine code at runtime for faster execution.

Q10. What is a Java compiler and what does it produce?
It converts Java source code into bytecode.

Q11. What are tokens in Java?
Smallest elements like keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, separators.

Q12. What are identifiers? Rules?
Names of variables/classes; must start with letter, _ or $, not a keyword.

Q13. Difference between keyword and identifier?
Keywords are reserved words; identifiers are user-defined names.

Q14. Why must main() be static?
So JVM can call it without creating an object.

Q15. Structure of a basic Java program?
Package → imports → class → main() method → statements.

Q16. What are primitive data types?
Basic data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.

Q17. What are non-primitive data types?
Reference types like String, arrays, classes, interfaces.

Q18. Why is String not primitive?
Because it is a class and provides methods.

Q19. What is a variable in Java?
A variable stores data values in memory.

Q20. Difference between local, instance, static variables?
Local: inside method, Instance: per object, Static: shared among objects.

Q21. What is a wrapper class? Why needed?
Converts primitives into objects; needed for collections and OOP features.

Q22. What is autoboxing?
Automatic conversion of primitive to wrapper object.

Q23. What is unboxing?
Automatic conversion of wrapper object to primitive.

Q24. What are operators? Types?
Symbols performing operations; arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, etc.

Q25. Difference between == and .equals()?
== compares references; .equals() compares content.

Q26. What is short-circuiting in && and ||?
Second condition is skipped if result is already known.

Q27. What is type casting?
Converting one data type into another.

Q28. What is widening type casting?
Converting smaller type to larger type automatically.

Q29. What is narrowing type casting?
Converting larger type to smaller type manually.

Q30. Why is narrowing not automatic?
It may cause data loss.

Q31. What happens if you cast double to int?
Decimal part is truncated.

Q32. What is type promotion in expressions?
Smaller data types are promoted to larger types automatically.

Q33. How do you take input using Scanner?
By creating Scanner object and using methods like nextInt().

Q34. Difference between nextInt() and nextLine()?
nextInt() reads integer, nextLine() reads full line.

Q35. Purpose of Math class?
Provides mathematical functions like sqrt, pow, max.

Q36. Name 3 Math class methods.
sqrt(), pow(), max().

Q37. What are built-in packages?
Predefined Java packages like java.lang, java.util.

Q38. What are user-defined packages?
Packages created by programmers to organize classes.

Q39. What are access modifiers?
They control visibility of classes and members.

Q40. Explain public, private, protected, default.
Public: everywhere, Private: same class, Protected: same package/subclass, Default: same package.

Q41. Explain Input → Process → Output cycle.
Data is taken as input, processed, and result is produced as output.

Q42. What happens when you compile a Java program?
Source code is converted into bytecode.

Q43. What happens when you run a Java program?
JVM loads bytecode and executes it.

Q44. Use of System.out.println()?
Prints output to the console.

Q45. Why do we need a main method?
It is the entry point of Java program execution.

Q46. Can a Java program run without main()?
No, JVM needs main() to start execution (except applets/JavaFX).
